# Caesar-Cipher-in-Python
A Caesar Cipher that can achieve three functions: multi-level encryption, multi-level decryption and multi-level code breaking. 
Multi-level encryption: encrypt messages, given the shifts and the starting position of each shift
Multi-level decryption: decrypt messages, given the shifts and the starting position of each shift
Multi-level code breaking: find the message before encryption with unknow shifts
